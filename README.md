## Technical Walkthrough

Our goal was to make learning engaging for young kids. As the lead developer on the project, I suggested a color matching game would be both useful for kids and attainable in our project timeframe.
Through SwiftUI, ConfettiSwiftUI package, AVFoundation for sound, learning @State variables, Stacks, and nested if-statements, we were able to create a simple color matching game to make learning fun for kids.
We also were able to save the user's score and display confetti at the end of the game if the user got all answers correct.
